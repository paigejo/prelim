Geostatistical inference under preferential sampling
P. J. Diggle, R. Menezes and T. Su
Appl. Statist., 59 (2010), 191 -- 232


We thank the Ecotoxicology Group, University of Santiago de Compostela, for permission to use the Galicia data and, in particular, José Angel Fernández, for helpful discussions concerning the data.

The data are listed in the data file as two 'geodata' objects for analysis using the geoR software (see http://www.leg.ufpr.br/geoR/).

Each objects contains (x,y)-coordinates ($coords) and lead concentrations ($data).

Objects 'lead97' and lead00 refer to geostatistical surveys conducted in 1997 and 2000
respectively.
